## How Computers Works
-   Input to output process: into the process from the outside. The processing step includes all tasks required to effect a transformation of the inputs. The outputs are the data and materials flowing out of the transformation process.

-  Computer's processor are made up of billions of transistors . 
A transistor is a tiny switch that is activated by the electronic signals it receives. 
The digits 1 and 0 used in binary reflect the on and off states of a transistor.

- Logic circuits include such devices as multiplexers, registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and computer memory, all the way up through complete microprocessors, which may contain more than 100 million gates. In modern practice, most gates are made from MOSFETs.

- Computer Applications Technology is the study of the integrated components of a computer system (hardware and software) and the practical techniques for their efficient use and application to solve everyday problems.
