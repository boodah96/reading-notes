# React Native
- 1.Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”

Ducks is a way to bundle reducers, action types, and actions into the same file. Rather than splitting up related code, it can be packaged into redux modules.

- 2.What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code

## TERMS

- `Redux Toolkit slices`: Redux slice is a collection of reducer logic and actions for a single feature of application . Redux state is typically organized into slices, defined by the reducers that are passed to combineReducers (source: Redux toolkit 
- `Namespace`: Programming paradigm of providing scope to identifiers (names of types, functions, variables, etc) to prevent collisions between them. JavaScript does not provide namespace by default. However, we can replicate this functionality by making a global object which can contain all functions and variables.


#### React Native

- React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks

- there is no difference in handling the state between React and React Native.

- Expo handles the gritty parts of building for each app store so you don't need Xcode or Android Studio to get your app into people's hands.
