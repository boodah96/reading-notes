# Lists

* Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.

# Boxes

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.

* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.

* You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.

* It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.

* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.

* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.

* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

# Basic JavaScript Instructions

* you can see anarray created using a differenttechnique called an array
**constructor**.

* You should consider using anarray whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that
are related to each other.
* Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list, It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero.

# Decisions and Loops

* Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.

* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.

* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.

* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

* switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).

* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.

* There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
