##  Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling
* Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

* When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.

* Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.

## Tables
- When representing information in a table, you need to think in terms of a grid made up of rows and columns (a bit like a
spreadsheet). In this chapter you will learn how to:
```
● Use the four key elements for creating tables
● Represent complex data using tables
● Add captions to tables
```

- Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. In HTML a table is written out row by row.

- You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects

- In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.

- Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.

- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
- methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
