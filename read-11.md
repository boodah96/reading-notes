# EJS
### is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.\

EJS has a large community of active users, and the library is under active development.

# Features
- Control flow with `<% %>`
- Escaped output with `<%= %> `(escape function configurable)
- Unescaped raw output with `<%- %>`
- Newline-trim mode ('newline slurping') with` -%> `ending tag
- Whitespace-trim mode (slurp all whitespace) for control flow with `<%_ _%>`
- Custom delimiters (e.g. [? ?] instead of `<% %>`)
