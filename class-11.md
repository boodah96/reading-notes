HTML5 comes with elements for embedding rich media in documents — <video\> and <audio\> — which in turn come with their own APIs for controlling playback, seeking, etc. Part of the HTML5 spec, the HTMLMediaElement API provides features to allow you to control video and audio players programmatically — for example HTMLMediaElement.play(), HTMLMediaElement.pause(), etc. This interface is available to both <audio\> and <video\> elements, as the features you'll want to implement are nearly identical. Let's go through an example, adding features as we go.

* You can control the size of animage using the width andheight properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box. 

+ You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.

+ Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.

+ You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page. 

+ Search engine optimization helps visitors find your
sites when using search engines.

+ Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to
see how many people visit your site, how they find it,
and what they do when they get there.

+ To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a
domain name and web hosting.

+ FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your
local computer to your web server.
