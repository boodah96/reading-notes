- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
- The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). 

- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,
strings, and true or false values known as
Boolean.
