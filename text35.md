# Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

### TERMS:
- `Vertex `: A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- `Edge `: An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- `Neighbor` : The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- `Degree` : The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

### Operations

The basic operations provided by a graph data structure G usually include:

- adjacent(G, x, y): tests whether there is an edge from the vertex x to the vertex y;
- neighbors(G, x): lists all vertices y such that there is an edge from the vertex x to the vertex y;
- add_vertex(G, x): adds the vertex x, if it is not there;
- remove_vertex(G, x): removes the vertex x, if it is there;
- add_edge(G, x, y): adds the edge from the vertex x to the vertex y, if it is not there;
- remove_edge(G, x, y): removes the edge from the vertex x to the vertex y, if it is there;
- get_vertex_value(G, x): returns the value associated with the vertex x;
- set_vertex_value(G, x, v): sets the value associated with the vertex x to v.
- Structures that associate values to the edges usually also provide
