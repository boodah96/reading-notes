## Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

# OBJECT
* Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names. 

* If a variable is part of an object, it is called aproperty. Properties tell us about the object, such as the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has.

# Document Object Model

* The DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure this model using a DOM tree. 

* The DOM also defines methods and properties to access and update each object in this model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser. 

* In a static Nodelist when your script updates the page, the NodeList is not updated to reflect the changes made by the script.
