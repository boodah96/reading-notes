## Node.js 
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. It is used for developing applications that make heavy use of the ability to run JavaScript both on the client, as well as on server side and therefore benefit from the re-usability of code and the lack of context switching.

*  Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words.
* npm : Node Package Manager.
