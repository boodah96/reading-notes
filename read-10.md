 # call stack
  is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

  - The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom.

  -  function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
