 ## Chart.js, Canvas
```
Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.
At first sight a <canvas\> (Links to an external site.) looks like the <img\> (Links to an external site.) element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas\> element has only two attributes, width (Links to an external site.) and height (Links to an external site.). These are both optional and can also be set using DOM (Links to an external site.) properties (Links to an external site.). 
 When you set the strokeStyle and/or fillStyle property, the new value becomes the default for all shapes being drawn from then on. For every shape you want in a different color, you will need to reassign the fillStyle or strokeStyle property.
In Gecko (the rendering engine of Firefox, Firefox OS and other Mozilla based applications), some prefixed APIs (Links to an external site.) were implemented in earlier versions to draw text on a canvas. These are now deprecated and removed, and are no longer guaranteed to work.
