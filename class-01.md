# HTML Structure
* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.

# Extra Markup
*  DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.

* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The div and span elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
X iframes cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
X The meta tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
X Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

#  Process & Design
- Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines and FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your
local computer to your web server
- Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email
newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website
tools (to save you writing them from scratch).

# HTML5 Layout
 
 - It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return and talk about Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.

- Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized


# ABC Java Script
## A : What is a script and how do I create one?
* A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task .


## B : How do computers fit in with the worl around them ?
* In computer programming, each physical thing in
the world can be represented as an object
* WHAT IS AN EVENT?
There are common ways in which people interact
with each type of object. 
* Computers use data to create models of things in the real world.
The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to each other:
Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an
object's properties. 

## C : How do I write a script for a web page
* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.
