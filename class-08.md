# CSS Layout

+ CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in itsown box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box

- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

+ If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

+ Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the
size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.

- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
